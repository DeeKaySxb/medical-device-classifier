# medical_device_classifier

This app is used to classify a medical device. It is an implementation of the classification rules 
according to MDR Annex VIII (EU 2017/745) agreed by the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union on 5 April 2017.

## Introduction and Goals
Annex VIII of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) describes rules for a classification process of 
medical devices. The aim is to transfer these rules into an application for training purposes, 
which users can use to classify easily their medical device. The final application will be available 
online as a web page and as an application in the Android Play Store or Apple's App Store.

### Requirements Overview
#### R1 Is medical device tester

#### R2 Medical device classification
#### R3 Definitions specific to classification rules
