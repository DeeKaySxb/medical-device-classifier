/// The `Bootstrap` abstract class defines a contract for bootstrapping operations.
///
/// Subclasses that implement this contract should provide an implementation
/// for the `boot` method, which is responsible for initializing components or
/// performing any necessary setup during the bootstrapping process.
///
/// This class is intended to be subclassed, and its `boot` method overridden to
/// perform custom bootstrapping logic.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyBootstrap extends Bootstrap {
///   @override
///   Future<bool> boot() async {
///     // Implement bootstrapping logic here.
///     return true; // Return true if bootstrapping succeeds.
///   }
/// }
/// ```
abstract class Bootstrap {
  /// Initializes the bootstrapping process.
  ///
  /// This method should be overridden in subclasses to perform asynchronous or
  /// synchronous operations required during bootstrapping.
  ///
  /// Example:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Future<bool> boot() async {
  ///   await _loadDecisionTree();
  ///   await _loadDefinitions();
  ///   await _loadImplementingRules();
  ///   return true; // Return true if bootstrapping succeeds.
  /// }
  /// ```
  Future<bool> boot();
}

/// The `BootstrapImpl` class is an implementation of the `Bootstrap` contract.
///
/// It provides a concrete implementation of the `boot` method, where various
/// asynchronous operations can be performed to initialize components or data
/// during the bootstrapping process.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```dart
/// final bootstrap = BootstrapImpl();
/// bootstrap.boot();
/// ```
class BootstrapImpl implements Bootstrap {
  /// Creates an instance of `BootstrapImpl`.
  const BootstrapImpl();

  /// Initializes the bootstrapping process.
  ///
  /// This method is responsible for performing asynchronous operations to
  /// initialize components or data during the bootstrapping process.
  ///
  /// It loads a decision tree, definitions, and implementing rules.
  ///
  /// Example:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Future<bool> boot() async {
  ///   await _loadDecisionTree();
  ///   await _loadDefinitions();
  ///   await _loadImplementingRules();
  ///   return true; // Return true if bootstrapping succeeds.
  /// }
  /// ```
  @override
  Future<bool> boot() async {
    await _loadDecisionTree();
    await _loadDefinitions();
    await _loadImplementingRules();

    return true;
  }

  /// Private method to load a decision tree asynchronously.
  ///
  /// This method loads the decision tree data asynchronously.
  Future<void> _loadDecisionTree() async {
    // Implement the logic to load the decision tree here.
  }

  /// Private method to load definitions asynchronously.
  ///
  /// This method loads definitions asynchronously.
  Future<void> _loadDefinitions() async {
    // Implement the logic to load definitions here.
  }

  /// Private method to load implementing rules asynchronously.
  ///
  /// This method loads implementing rules asynchronously.
  Future<void> _loadImplementingRules() async {
    // Implement the logic to load implementing rules here.
  }
